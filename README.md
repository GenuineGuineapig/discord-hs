This repository contains a discord bot written in haskell, which uses the `polysemi` library for higher-order, no-boilerplate, zero-cost monads. 

So, since the owner of this repository (cnr) seems to be busy and does not provide his own readme, I (GenuineGuineapig, from the "youbetterhaveareadme-association") am taking this into my own hands.
By providing a readme I plan on providing a solution which will in return improve the lives of many people, which will now be able to read this text and then kickstart their development of another, possible better (but probably worse) discord bot which will eventually gain his own artificial intelligence and thus destroying the world and everything that we've ever loved and/or known.

Let me start by giving you an overall view of the really important bits of this project. We can categorize this project in three aspects:

* Legal stuff (Stuff which you will need to read because otherwise you might end up in jail)
* Source code stuff (the really interesting stuff)
* Unnessary stuff (the stuff you and I don't care about, but have to be there for some reason)

As it is really important to have a clean project structure, we can keep this short:

Legal stuff:
- LICENSE: Read this so you know wether or not you can use the project. 

Sourcecode: 
- Basicly the whole folder called src (yep, I know. I, myself, was amazed)
- Setup.hs	
- cabal.project
- discord-hs.cabal

Unnessary Stuff (please don't think that you can remove it - you can, but then stuff breaks)
- package.yaml


Congratulations to you for coming this far in this readme. Now you know everything I know and can start making the world a better place, by developing your very own bot which will end all the mean things which are currently happening. Enjoy!
